## About our Community Project

**Project Impact**

Our project makes a real-world impact in addressing the challenge by providing users with information concerning their community's environment and then immediately offering ways to start getting involved and becoming part of a solution rather than just monitoring the problem. 

**Innovation**

Our community page  is innovative and creative and takes a novel approach by bringing together innovative tools and information to evoke climate empathy and become the catalyst for action. 

**Clarity**

Our project includes the following to make information and tools clear, accessible. and easy to understand:

*bootstrap buttons
*quick navigation links
*filter options

<!--Does it present information clearly?-->

**Implementation**

Our community page  provides a new functional solution in the area(s) of providing users concerned with environmental issues information on their community and ways to communicate, volunteer and assist (mainly take immediate action)


**Integration**

New additions created for our project integrate with other work and data in the following ways:

*creating a one stop shop for environmental information and action
*providing the public an opportunity to participate in change regardless of technical skills/background, time constraints, etc. 
*for future features, could automatically pull info like zip codes to automatically provide representative contact details, local organizations, events, news, etc.
